evapVOFHardt
============

This git repository was created Bruno Santos (wyldckat@github), based on the original files that are available here: http://www.ttd.tu-darmstadt.de/forschung_1/openfoamdatenbank/evapvofhard.en.jsp - Quoting from that page:

    Solver for the simulation of two phase flows with phase change (without contact line evaporation) based on Hardt/Wondra (Journal of Computational Physics, 2008).
    In case of further questions please contact M.Sc. Stefan Batzdorf.
    
The original source code was developped for OpenFOAM 2.1.0 and this repository aims to extend functionality to other OpenFOAM versions and variants.

It has been created after finding this thread: http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-programming-development/135891-problem-compiling-new-solver.html


Documentation
=============

Have a look into the files `Documentation_evapVOF.pdf` and `example.mpg`.
